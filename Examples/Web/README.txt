Welcome to FlaskFit, an example of creating a
web-based curve and surface fitting tool with
Python Flask and the pyeq2 fitting library.
see http://commonproblems.readthedocs.io/en/latest/


Step 1: Install flask, scipy and matplotlib

On Debian or Ubuntu Linux, you can use this command:

sudo apt-get install python-flask python-scipy python-matplotlib


On other operating systems, try the Canopy Express Free version:

https://store.enthought.com/

and then install Flask with:

easy_install Flask



Step 2: Run the FlaskFit example

From a command prompt run this command:

python FlaskFit.py

The command prompt should then display:

* Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/

When you open this URL you should see a form
that allows curve and surface fitting, with graphs.
The address "0.0.0.0" allows port 5000 to be seen
externally.  On my development laptop, I can open
the URL "127.0.0.1:5000/" and see the web server.

Use Control-C to exit the Flask development server.



Step 3: Celebrate

You are now curve and surface fitting data using Flask!



Look at the other pyeq2 examples for more information on
topics such as parallel processing or "function finding".
